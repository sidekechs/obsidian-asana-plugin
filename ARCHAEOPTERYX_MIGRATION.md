# Archaeopteryx Migration Guide

The new Asana Integration (Enovara Dev) plugin includes all archaeopteryx functionality with the same keyboard shortcuts!

## Features Implemented

### 1. Get Daily Tasks (`Alt+Shift+D`)
- Fetches all tasks due today or overdue from all your Asana projects
- Creates a "Daily Tasks" note with organized tasks by project
- Shows priority indicators (ðŸ”´ High, ðŸŸ¡ Medium, ðŸŸ¢ Low)
- Marks overdue tasks with ðŸ”´ OVERDUE

### 2. Save Task (`Alt+Shift+S`)
- Works with inline checkbox tasks: `- [ ] Task name`
- Creates new tasks in Asana if no GID exists
- Updates existing tasks if GID is present
- Automatically adds metadata after saving:
  ```markdown
  - [ ] My task
    - asana_gid:: 1234567890
    - permalink:: https://app.asana.com/...
    - assignee:: John Doe
  ```

### 3. Complete Task (`Alt+Shift+C`)
- Marks the task at cursor as complete in Asana
- Updates the checkbox to `[x]`
- Works with both new and existing tasks

### 4. Update Task (`Alt+Shift+U`)
- Updates an existing task's name and metadata in Asana
- Only works with tasks that have an asana_gid

## Task Format

The plugin recognizes tasks in this format:
```markdown
- [ ] Task title
  - asana_gid:: 1234567890
  - permalink:: https://app.asana.com/0/...
  - assignee:: John Doe
  - notes:: Task description
  - due_date:: 2024-01-15
```
